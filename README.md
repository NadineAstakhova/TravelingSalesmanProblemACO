# TravelingSalesmanProblemACO

Ant Colony Optimization for Traveling Salesman Problem. 

ACO is a genetic algorithm inspired by an antâ€™s natural behavior. Basic concepts of the ACO algorithm: 
<ul>
<li>ants use pheromones to find the shortest path between home and food source
<li>pheromones evaporate quickly
<li>ants prefer to use shorter paths with denser pheromone
</ul>
